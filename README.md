## Muhammad Al-Atrash

I'm a computer science and engineering student at The University of Virginia with experience building full-stack web and mobile applications. Currently, I have two live projects: 

- ðŸ¤– [**Decentralized Sentiment-Based Content Recommender System**]: Developing a privacy-preserving AI content recommendation system to demonstrate comparable recommendation quality to centralized systems while protecting user privacy. Data collection system connects to Reddit API to scrape public posts adn generates mock private user interaction data. Federated learning architecture performs dual sentiment analysis to classify content (achieving ~90% global model performance). 
- ðŸŽµ [**Music Player Mobile Application**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz3bGXdSrzQ&feature=youtu.be): A fully functional music player built using **React Native**, **TypeScript**, and **Firebase**.


ðŸ’» Academic Projects:
- Full-stack web application for tracking honor code violations (**Django**, **PostgreSQL**, **AWS S3**, **Google OAuth**).
- **Python** Bitcoin blockchain parsing script and **Solidity** smart contracts for decentralized finance applications.
- Neural network model for music genre classification tasks (**PyTorch**).
