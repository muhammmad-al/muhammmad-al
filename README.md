'm a computer science and engineering student at UVA with experience building full-stack web and mobile applications. Currently, I have two live projects: a music player mobile app (React Native, TypeScript, Firebase) and an NFT auction platform frontend (React, Node.js, Heroku). 

Previous projects include blockchain parsing scripts, neural network models, and DEX smart contracts.
